# Pages and sub-component

## Pages in Albiziapp 

Since Albiziapp aims to mimic mobile look and feels, it is structured using the "page pattern". 

Think of a page as **a specific screen of a mobile app**. Pages are practical for **performing fast, focused interactions**. They usually have only one purpose, and they take all the screen.

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
