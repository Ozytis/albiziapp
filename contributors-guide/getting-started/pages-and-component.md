# Pages and component

## Pages in Albiziapp 

Since Albiziapp aims to mimic mobile look and feels, it is structured using the "page pattern". 

Think of a page as a specific screen of a mobile app. Pages are practical for performing fast interactions. They usually have only one purpose, and they take all the screen. 

 

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
