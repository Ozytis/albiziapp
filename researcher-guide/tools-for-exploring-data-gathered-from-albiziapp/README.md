# Tools for exploring data gathered from Albiziapp

## Needs for specific tooling

It quickly became apparent that the amount of data that will produce users will be important. And that exploitative tools to handle these data will be useful. 

#### 

\*\*\*\*



```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
