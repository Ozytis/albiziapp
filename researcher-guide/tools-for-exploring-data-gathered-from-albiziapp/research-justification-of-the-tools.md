# Research justification of the tools

#### Research in TEL

From the researcher in TEL point of view, it is vital to collect field data concerning user activity "within" Albiziapp:

* Learner activity \(in spacialized context\)
* Learner satisfaction \(indirect gathering or through questionnary\)
* Influence of game mechanics  
* Influence of experimental conditions
* ...

Together with data concerning user activity in the real world :

* Position for observation T
* Accuracy for observation T \(species/genus correct?\)
* Accuracy for modification N over another user observation
* ...

These field data will allow to conclude or not on the usefulness of the system. In order to be able to state that the system is useful on the educational perspective, we need to establish clear correlations between user activity "within" the app and correctness/accuracy/progression in "the real world".

If a user create ten observation, the only way to assess their correctness is for a field expert to actually go to the user position, look at the taken picture \(if given\) and assess that the information given by the user are correct.
